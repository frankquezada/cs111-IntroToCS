Hello there!
Today we will calculate package end to end delays
over a network.

The following are the given parameters:

Distance package is sent = 1000.0 meters
The Speed of light is = 3.0E8 meters/second
The packet size is = 12000.0 bits
The bandwidth is = 1.0E8 bits/second

The end to end delay time is = 1.2333333333333334E-4 seconds

You can change the distance in my code to see how
distance affects delay times.
