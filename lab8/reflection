Reflection

In this assignment I had one big issue and that is the public void and public
static void statements. I am still a little confused of how we know which one
to use. I read some content from the book that talks about this and it did help
in improving my understanding. I made minor syntax errors. I have used if/else 
statements before in Fortran and Python so I have a good sense of how they work.
I think what helps out the most is thinking through and planning out how you want your
program to look and function before beggining to write it; this helps me be more 
efficient.
