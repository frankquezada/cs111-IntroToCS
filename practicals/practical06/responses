Do you recognize the names of any of the gvim plugins as they are being installed?
Yes

What do they do?
Change color scheme, indetation, word guessing and spell checking, etc.

5 ways that it is different from standard GVim:
Background Color
Java Keyword guess
Closes paranthesis, brackets, quotes, etc.
Have line numbers on left column
Am able to delete lines faster using commands like "d", "dd", etc.

How does your chosen plugin work and what features does it provide?
It list each line, the color scheme has a dark background, and in Java (and I assume other languages like Python) it tries to guess keywords.
It also shows how many spaces are in indentations (visually) and it allows you to access your directory from the GVim window.

Do you plan to use this plugin on a regular basis?
Yes

Why or why not?
Time efficient, helpful visually, and assist when programming (e.g. checks for spelling errors)

Knowing these facts, what do you think that "gg=G" comman does?
Go to top of line and indent all the way to the bottom of the code.

How do: "u", "d", "dd", "dip" allow you to manipulate your source code?
u = undo
d = deletes chosen
dd = deletes current line
dip = deletes paragraph
